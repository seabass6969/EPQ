\section*{Meeting with the supervisor at \date{25 November 2024}}
Summary: 

Improve on the part A of the production logs, with more details on the titles described and what resources I will be using (such as the URLs should be provided), the timescale and what is involve. 

As things I should be including to create a great project is the benefit that this might bring to the society and the impact.  

And a plan to see what I should be sending or showing to the examiner in the future such as:  

\begin{itemize}
    \item Send product log 
    \item Presentation of the artefact 
    \item Evidence of the artefact 
    \item Critical bibliography 
    \item Place that in the Appendix and write a reference back to the appendix through the production log.  
\end{itemize}
