\section*{Meeting with a professional at \date{13 January 2025}}
Summary:

I explained the background details during the meeting.

I have explained that the program can only detect sounds from following test that I conducted such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A test where there are no modifications to the original sound,
    \item A test where the song has cropped and reduced to a smaller size.
    \item A test where there is a constant noise generated by a program with a constant sine wave in the background.
    \item A test where the songs are mixed with a normal acceptable background noise such as coughing.
\end{itemize}

All of those above works as expected.

However the test that I did by recording when the sound is played on a music player on a different device doesnâ€™t work.

As an additional note, he has mentioned that the program is slow because of a reason which might be caused by the hash point not being an integer, as the hash value using integer is faster than using string as hash. (It was diagnosed with a slow database reading speed prior to the meeting).

The project has concluded as partially successful from the results produced from the searching algorithm. 

\textbf{Summary of Improvement I need to make from the project.}

I should use a different hashing algorithm for the fingerprinting part of the program.

Round up the frequency, and the changes in time that are fed into the hashing algorithm.

\textbf{Additional note:}

The meetings are conducted with the consent of the professional. (With regards to the ethical issues)

The professional is my computer science teacher, as he has a decent qualification of a university degree.
